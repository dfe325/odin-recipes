    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <p>
        Step 1
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook celery at a boil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3
        Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the melted butter until softened,
        5 to
        10 minutes. Whisk flour into onion mixture until the butter and flour form a paste. Add mushroom soup, milk, and
        mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.

    <p>
        Step 4
        Mix turkey, celery, pimento peppers, almonds, and salt into mushroom soup mixture; cook and stir until heated
        through,
        about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a 2-quart casserole dish; top with bread crumbs and Cheddar cheese.
